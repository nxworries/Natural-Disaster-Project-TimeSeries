Project Decscription:

This was a project completed in the course Statistical Methods and Applications II at CU Boulder.  This project attempts to answer the question: Have the frequency of natural disasters been increasing over time? by doing a time series analysis on natural disaster data going back up to 70 years. This was likely a naive project idea due to the relative timescale of the data, but was a good first exposure to time series.
